Full-Stack Engineering portfolio
### My experience
This github will document my journey in completing the Full-stack Engineer course from Codecademy. I will be posting projects I have completed/am working on and explain my work as I progress. 
### Previous Experience
Here is a link to my other project from a class I took my fall semester of college. It is my introduction into working software such as GitHub, Python, HTML, and getting to know the basics of computer science.
